    <h1 style="color:blue">My first week at AkiraChix</h1>
    <p>During the day of admission, I learned many things about the school.This is when 
        i realized the people in the school are caring and loving, because
    they help <br> by giving us direction and advice on how to proceed on our contract.
In the meeting our parents were told more about the school. when the meeting was off the parents departed.I felt lonely when my parents
went<br> but on the following day atleast  i adapted the environment. Though i have struggle
to know more about the area,<br> but I have atleast  known.     </p>
